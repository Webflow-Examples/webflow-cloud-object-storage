## Who this project is for

This project is intended for developers who want to implement file upload functionality in their Webflow Cloud applications. Whether you're building a content management system, a file sharing platform, or need to handle user-generated content, this project provides the foundation you need.

## Project dependencies

Before using Astro - Webflow Cloud File Upload Demo, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Webflow Cloud** with Object Storage enabled - [Sign up here](https://webflow.com/signup)
- **Basic knowledge** of Astro, React, and TypeScript
- **GitHub** for version control

## Getting Started

Get started with the demo by cloning the repository and setting up your development environment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webflow-cloud/file-uploader.git
   cd file-uploader
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs all required packages including Astro, React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers dependencies.

### Configure

1. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   ORIGIN=http://localhost:4321
   ```

2. **Configure `wrangler.json`**

   Update `wrangler.json` with a new Object storage bucket

   ```json
   {
     "name": "astro-r2-file-upload",
     "compatibility_date": "2024-01-01",
     "r2_buckets": [
       {
         "binding": "CLOUD_FILES",
         "bucket_name": "your-bucket-name"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Upate Astro Config**
   In `astro.config.mjs` to include the base path for your environment and the `assetsPrefix` to match the mount path of your environment.

   ```ts title="astro.config.mjs"
   export default defineConfig({
     base: "/YOUR_MOUNT_PATH",
     build: {
       assetsPrefix: "/YOUR_MOUNT_PATH",
     },

     // Additional configuration options...
   });
   ```

### Create a Webflow Cloud Project

1. **Create Project**

   In Webflow, go to the Webflow Cloud tab of your site settings.

   1. Go to your Webflow Cloud dashboard
   2. Click "Create new project"
   3. Name your project
   4. Choose the `object-storage-example` repository
   5. Click "Create project"

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

2. **Create an Environment**

   Create a new environment for the `full-app` branch.

   1. In the same modal, choose the `full-app` branch
   2. Choose a mount path for the environment (for example, /app ‚Üí mysite.webflow.io/app)
   3. Click "Create environment"
   4. Publish your Webflow site to make your environment live.

3. **Add Environment Variables in Webflow Cloud**
   In your environment dashboard, click the "Environment Variables" tab and add the following environment variable:

   ```bash title=".env"
   ORIGIN=YOUR_WEBFLOW_CLOUD_DOMAIN
   ```

## Deploy the App

1. **Commit and push your changes**
   To deploy your app to Webflow Cloud, commit and push your changes.

## View your app in Webflow Clou

Go to you domain and base path in Webflow Cloud to start uploading file.

### Troubleshoot Astro R2 File Upload Demo

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CORS errors during upload**         | Ensure your using the `ASSET_PREFIX` environment variables for all endpoints. Add your Webflow Cloud domain to allowed origins. |
| **Upload fails with large files**     | Check your Webflow Cloud limits. Multipart uploads handle files up to 5GB.                                                      |
| **Environment variables not loading** | Verify your `.env` file is in the project root and variables are correctly named.                                               |
